## Search Suggestion:

## Assets:
- Basic express application, serving a single, root endpoint
- HTML Text input element (id: "target")
- A JSON file, containing the NATO Phonetic Alphabet, in the following format: {"A": "Alfa", "B": "Bravo" ... "Z": "Zulu"}

## Goal:
Acquire entries in the dataset that match user input and display them in a dropdown menu.

### Example:
User enters the string '__er__', which matches the entries __"N": "November"__ and __"S": "Sierra"__, so we want to see those resultant entries in a dropdown, similar to the image in _example.png_.

### Guidelines:
- Any style you wish to use is acceptable, you are not restricted to using classes, functions, IIFEs, etc. 
- The dropdown menu should be responsive to user input, adding/removing elements as needed
- If possible within the time-frame, a simple UX feature would be to highlight the matching substring within the result set dropdown
- We estimate this should take less than 90 minutes to implement.

### Code Styling:
- Feel free to use any code styling you wish for this project. We try to subscribe to Sandi Metz “[Rules for developers](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/sandi-metz-rules-for-developers)” whenever possible in our actual codebase, as it makes for easy to refactor/test code, but that is not necessary for this exercise.
